# Major League Hacking Mentorship Guide

## Welcome
Welcome to our landing page for students in the [MLH](https://fellowship.mlh.io) mentoring program! We hope you become part of our diverse community and join our efforts to advance time series analysis capabilities!

## Why sktime?
Time series data is ubiquitous in many applications. Examples include sensor readings from industrial processes, spectroscopy wave length data from chemical samples, or bed-side monitor medical data from patients. Developing advanced time series analysis capabilities for researchers and practitioners is one of the major challenges of contemporary machine learning.

sktime is a new Python toolbox for machine learning with time series, and to our knowledge, the first unified framework for time series analysis covering multiple distinct but related learning problems. Our ambition is to provide for time series what scikit-learn is providing for cross-sectional data. This involves community building, software development, design and maintenance. We are currently developing functionality for various time series learning tasks, such as time series classification, clustering and forecasting. To find out more, check out our [paper](http://learningsys.org/neurips19/assets/papers/sktime_ml_systems_neurips2019.pdf) published at the [Workshop on Systems for ML at NeurIPS 2019](http://learningsys.org/neurips19/).

## What we are looking for
We're actively looking for contributors and your help is extremely welcome. Therefore, if
 * you are interested in time series, machine learning (ML), statistics, API design and software architecture,
 * you like coding in Python,
 * you are familiar with the basic data science ecosystem in Python, including numpy, pandas and scikit-learn,
 * you enjoy working with a vibrant team of experienced ML scientists and software engineers,
 * you always wanted to join an open-source community,

then sktime is for you!

## What you can expect
One of our core developers will join the weekly calls with your MHL mentor and will generally be available to answer questions.

In addition to the individual project work, you will have the opportunity to:
 * peer-review a fellow student's or other contributor's work,
 * write blog posts about your contribution,
 * have a good time web-socializing with the other contributors.

One of our key goals is to onboard new *long-term* developers who are willing to step up and become next generation leaders in open-source toolbox development. We explicitly encourage female and non-binary students, or of minority/underrepresented groups in the tech sector.

## Projects
Please find below a list topics to help you get started. But please don't hesitate to propose your own topic to work on. Please check out our [development roadmap](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/228) and [good first issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/labels/good%20first%20issue) to get an idea of the topics we're working on.
