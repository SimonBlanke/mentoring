# Google Summer of Docs projects 2024

sktime is applying for Google Summer of Docs 2024.

We are looking for technical writers with an interest in ML/AI and a background in python.
See [here for GSoD's application guide(https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-guide).

Organizations apply for GSoD with proposals, and are asked to pre-identify interested technical writers.
Parameters of the project are: 3-6 months, 5-15k USD.

Timelines ([more details on GSoD](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline)):

* we will know on April 10 whether sktime is accepted for GSoD
* hiring must be complete by May 22 or before

### Project 1: improving user journey in retrieving algorithms, tags, metadata

`sktime` is a library in a quite literal sense of the word - it provides unified interfaces to hundreds of objects (at time of writing: 392),
among them ML/AI algorithms, and other objects such as performance metrics. The objects can be contributed and maintained by anyone in the world.

The full list of objects is presented on the [searchable estimator table, on the sktime webpage](https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/estimator_overview.html),
and can be also retrieved and searched via python, in the library, e.g.,

```python
from sktime.registry import all_estimators

res = all_estimators()
```

Each estimator has tags, e.g., forecasters can be inspected regarding their capabilities, such as being able to make in-sample predictions, probabilistic forecasts, etc.

The user journey in the `sktime` documentation has not been too great in providing the user with access to this information.
While it is possible to retrieve everything in python, the ambition is to make it as easy as possible to obtain the same in our online documentation, in static and interactive elements.

Further, basic information on the taxonomic primitives, e.g., basic estimator types, data types, tags, is missing from the on-line documentation. Examples: what is forecaster, what does it mean to forecast in-sample.
Pages with such information should be created, and cross-linked from the top and mid level API documentation.

### Goal

* user journey design and implementation of improvements to the online documentation, for presentation, lookup, and interlinkage of estimators, algorithms, and other first-class objects in `sktime`
* added technical documentation on taxonomic primitives, e.g., estimator types, data types, tags, in the web documentation
* extensions of `python` code in the package, estimator taxonomy, or web logic that make it easier for the user to search, retrieve, and understand algorithms by their capabilities
* bonus: improvements to formal algorithm taxonomies and core interfaces of the python objects, motivated by improved user journeys, categories, or common user taxonomies not currently mirrored in the `python` design

### Measures of success

* positive user feedback through existing feedback channels (user feedback thread, discord)
* increase in references using new structure/taxonomy made by developers on the help desk
* increase of meaningful user journeys through the estimator tables and potential tag-specific cross-links

### Useful skills

* technical writing with some background in ML, AI, data science, statistics or mathematics
* entry level familiarity with the python data science ecosystem, optimally scikit-learn or comparable packages (not strictly needed)
* basic understanding of data base schemas or object taxonomies
* familiarity with basic contribution workflows using git, GitHub
* nice to have: familiarity with sphinx, reStructuredText, markdown
